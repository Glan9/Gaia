# Gaia

A work-in-progress golfing language inspired by [CJam](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cjam/), [Jelly](https://github.com/DennisMitchell/jelly), [Ohm](https://github.com/nickbclifford/Ohm), and [SOGL](https://github.com/dzaima/SOGL).

## Running Gaia

To run Gaia, simply download all files, then run `python gaia.py <filename>`. Additionally, you can run it with the `-e` flag, which runs a program encoded using Gaia's codepage.

## Documentation

Some documentation is available on the [wiki](https://github.com/splcurran/Gaia/wiki); however, the documentation is still mostly incomplete.
