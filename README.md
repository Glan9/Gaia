# Gaia

A work-in-progress golfing language inspired by [CJam](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cjam/), [Jelly](https://github.com/DennisMitchell/jelly), [Ohm](https://github.com/nickbclifford/Ohm), and [SOGL](https://github.com/dzaima/SOGL).

## Running Gaia

To run Gaia, simply download all files, then run `python gaia.py <filename>`. Additionally, you can run it with the `-e` flag, which runs a program encoded using Gaia's codepage.

Additionally, you may [Try it online!](https://tio.run/#gaia), courtesy of [DennisMitchell](https://github.com/DennisMitchell).

## Documentation

Some documentation is available on the [wiki](https://github.com/splcurran/Gaia/wiki).

## Bugs

As Gaia is still in development, there may be a lot of bugs that I don't catch. If you find anything you think might be a bug, please report it.
